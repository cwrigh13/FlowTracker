## Usage

### Basic Setup

The onboarding system is already integrated into FlowTracker:

1. **Provider Setup** - `OnboardingProvider` wraps the app in `main.tsx`
2. **Components Added** - Welcome modal and onboarding modal in `App.tsx`
3. **Automatic Trigger** - Welcome modal appears on first login
4. **Persistent State** - Progress saved in localStorage

### For Developers

#### Starting Onboarding Programmatically

```typescript
import { useOnboarding } from '../contexts/OnboardingContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { startOnboarding } = useOnboarding();
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => startOnboarding('admin')}>
      Start Admin Tour
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### Checking Onboarding Status

```typescript
const { state } = useOnboarding();

// Check if user has completed onboarding
if (state.completedAt) {
  console.log('User completed onboarding');
}

// Get progress
const progress = state.steps.filter(s => s.completed).length / state.steps.length;
```

#### Adding New Steps

Edit the step arrays in `OnboardingContext.tsx`:

```typescript
const ADMIN_STEPS: OnboardingStep[] = [
  // ... existing steps
  {
    id: 'new-feature',
    title: 'New Feature Title',
    description: 'Description of the new feature',
    completed: false,
  },
];
```

Then add corresponding rendering logic in `OnboardingModal.tsx`:

```typescript
case 'new-feature':
  return (
    <div className="py-6">
      <h2>Your New Feature</h2>
      {/* Content here */}
    </div>
  );
```

### For Product Managers

#### Tracking Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

**Quantitative:**
- Time to complete onboarding (by role)
- Step completion rates
- Skip/abandonment rates
- Feature adoption rates post-onboarding
- User retention at 7, 30, 90 days

**Qualitative:**
- User satisfaction surveys
- Support ticket volume during onboarding
- Feature requests from new users
- User feedback on clarity and helpfulness

#### A/B Testing Opportunities

The system is designed for experimentation:
- Different welcome messages
- Step ordering variations
- Content length and detail
- Engagement mechanics
- Visual design variations

### For Customer Success Teams

#### Guiding New Customers

When onboarding new libraries:

1. **Encourage the Tour** - "Have you completed the setup tour?"
2. **Reference Steps** - "Did you see the section on team invitations?"
3. **Restart If Needed** - Users can restart the tour from their profile
4. **Supplement with Video** - Record walkthroughs for specific ILS integrations

#### Common Support Scenarios

**User skipped onboarding:**
- They can restart it from the checklist (bottom-right corner)
- Or from their profile settings (if implemented)

**User stuck on a step:**
- Check localStorage for onboarding state
- Guide them to skip and continue
- Provide direct support for the blocking issue

## Customization

### Branding

Update colors in component files to match your brand:

```typescript
// Change from:
className="bg-blue-600"

// To your brand color:
className="bg-indigo-600"
```

### Content

All text content is in the component files. Update:
- Welcome messages in `WelcomeModal.tsx`
- Step content in `OnboardingModal.tsx`

### Adding New User Roles

To add a new onboarding path:

export type OnboardingPath = 'admin' | 'staff' | 'patron' | 'new-role' | 'none';
```

2. Create step array:
```typescript
const NEW_ROLE_STEPS: OnboardingStep[] = [ /* steps */ ];
```

3. Add to `getStepsForPath()` function

4. Add rendering logic in `OnboardingModal.tsx`

5. Update `WelcomeModal.tsx` to show option for new role
