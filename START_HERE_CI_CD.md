## 🚀 Try It Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Docker
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Wait ~30 seconds for services to start, then:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

### Step 2: Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Make a small change
git add .
git commit -m "feat: test CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

Then go to GitHub → **Actions** tab → Watch your pipeline run!

### Step 3: View Your Images
After CI/CD completes, check GitHub → **Packages** tab

You'll see:
- `flowtracker-frontend:latest`
- `flowtracker-backend:latest`

## 🎯 What This Gives You

### Before (Manual Process)
1. ❌ Manually run tests on your machine
2. ❌ Manually build frontend and backend
3. ❌ Manually copy files to server
4. ❌ Manually restart services
5. ❌ Hope everything works
6. ❌ Debug production issues

**Time**: 1-2 hours per deployment  
**Risk**: High (human error, environment differences)

### After (Automated CI/CD)
1. ✅ Git push automatically runs all tests
2. ✅ Automatically builds Docker images
3. ✅ Automatically publishes to registry
4. ✅ Automatically deploys (optional)
5. ✅ Automatically runs health checks
6. ✅ Automatically rolls back on failure

**Time**: 5-8 minutes per deployment  
**Risk**: Low (automated, tested, reproducible)

---

## 📊 Pipeline Features

## 💻 Essential Commands

### Start Development
```bash
docker-compose up                  # Start all services
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

### Stop Everything
```bash
docker-compose down                # Stop services
docker-compose down -v             # Stop + delete data
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f             # All services
docker-compose logs -f backend     # Just backend
```

### Run Tests
```bash
docker-compose run backend npm test    # Backend tests
docker-compose run frontend npm test   # Frontend tests
```

### Check Status
```bash
docker-compose ps                  # Container status
./scripts/health-check.sh          # Full health check
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Docker won't start
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Check if ports 3000, 5000, 5432 are available
3. Try: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up`

### Issue: CI tests failing
**Solution**:
1. Run tests locally: `docker-compose run backend npm test`
2. Check GitHub Actions logs for details
3. Ensure all tests pass locally first

### Issue: Can't access localhost:3000
**Solution**:
1. Check if frontend is running: `docker-compose ps`
2. View logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`
3. Restart: `docker-compose restart frontend`

**More help**: See `CI_CD_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
