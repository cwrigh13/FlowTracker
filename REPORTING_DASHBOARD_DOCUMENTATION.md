## Mock Data Implementation

For development and testing without a running backend, comprehensive mock data is provided in `src/services/mockApi.ts`:

- Realistic sample data for all metrics
- 30 days of historical trend data
- Multiple team members with varied workload
- Random but believable statistical patterns
- 500ms delay to simulate API calls

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- **Required Roles**: Admin or Manager only
- **Route Protection**: Backend middleware checks user role
- **UI Controls**: "Reports" button only visible to admins
- **Security**: All endpoints require valid authentication token

### User Experience
1. Admin logs in normally
2. Clicks "Reports" button in main dashboard header
3. Metrics dashboard loads with default 30-day view
4. Can switch tabs, change date ranges, and refresh data
5. Click "Back" arrow to return to main issue tracker

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimization
- **Database Indexes**: All key fields indexed for fast queries
- **Aggregate Queries**: Pre-calculated where possible
- **Date Filtering**: Always applied to limit data volume
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

### Frontend Optimization
- **Parallel Requests**: All metrics fetched simultaneously
- **Memoization**: React hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Components only render when tab is active
- **Efficient Re-rendering**: Only affected components update on data change

### Scalability
- Designed to handle 10,000+ issues without performance issues
- Queries optimized with proper WHERE clauses and indexes
- Pagination-ready (can be added if needed)
- Caching-ready (Redis can be added for further optimization)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Dashboard shows "No data available"
- **Solution**: Check date range isn't in the future, verify issues exist in selected period

**Problem**: Metrics don't update after refresh
- **Solution**: Check browser console for API errors, verify backend is running

**Problem**: Loading spinner stays forever
- **Solution**: Check API endpoints are accessible, verify authentication token is valid

**Problem**: Reports button not visible
- **Solution**: Ensure logged-in user has admin or manager role

**Problem**: Backend errors in metrics routes
- **Solution**: Verify database has required tables and indexes, check PostgreSQL is running
