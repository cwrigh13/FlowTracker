```
EB with load balancer
Cost: $16/month (or $0 without LB)
Users: 50-500
```

### Phase 3: Production
```
EB multi-instance + RDS Multi-AZ
Cost: $50-150/month

## üéØ My Recommendation

Based on your situation (free AWS trial account for testing):

### Start with Elastic Beanstalk (Single Instance Mode)

**Why:**
1. ‚úÖ **Stays $0** - Completely within Free Tier
2. ‚úÖ **Quick** - 20-30 minute deployment
3. ‚úÖ **Professional** - Real production-like environment
4. ‚úÖ **Scalable** - Easy to add resources later
5. ‚úÖ **Monitoring** - Built-in dashboards
6. ‚úÖ **Learning** - Teaches production AWS patterns
7. ‚úÖ **Shareable** - Get a URL to show others

**How to start:**
```bash
# Read this first (5 min)
cat AWS_QUICK_START.md

# Then follow this (25 min)
cat AWS_ELASTIC_BEANSTALK_GUIDE.md
```

**After you're comfortable with Elastic Beanstalk,** you can explore the EC2 direct deployment to learn more about AWS fundamentals.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this cost me money?
**Within Free Tier limits: $0/month**. The single-instance Elastic Beanstalk option stays completely free for 12 months. Set up billing alerts to be safe.

### What happens after 12 months?
Free Tier expires, and you'll start paying AWS standard rates (~$30-50/month for EB, ~$10/month for single EC2). You'll get alerts before charges start.

### Can I delete everything easily?
Yes! Run `eb terminate` or delete resources in AWS Console. All resources can be removed in minutes.

### Is this production-ready?
**Elastic Beanstalk**: Yes, production-ready from day one.  
**Single EC2**: Good for testing, but needs enhancements for production (load balancing, auto-scaling, monitoring).

### What if I get stuck?
Check the troubleshooting section in each guide. Use AWS Forums, Stack Overflow, or AWS Support (free basic support included).

### Can I change deployment methods later?
Yes! Your Docker containers work everywhere. You can migrate between EC2, EB, ECS, or EKS without code changes.
